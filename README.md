# 🧥 YOLOv11 Transfer Learning for Clothes Detection

This project applies **transfer learning** on the YOLOv11 (Ultralytics YOLOv8-compatible) object detection model to classify and localize 18 categories of clothing. The model was fine-tuned on a custom-labeled apparel dataset, achieving strong performance on unseen test images.

### 🔹 Evaluation Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;The trained model was evaluated using a combination of quantitative metrics and visual analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This section summarizes the key outcomes from the evaluation phase.
<br><br>
### 🔹 Confusion Matrix Analysis

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;To evaluate inter-class confusion, both the absolute and normalized confusion matrices were analyzed:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Most predictions align well along the diagonal, indicating strong classification accuracy.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• High accuracy was observed for classes such as shortpants, shortsleeve, and denimpants.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Some confusion was noted among visually similar categories, such as jacket, cardigan, sweater, and longsleeve.

### 🔹 Confidence-Based Metric Curves

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence-based evaluation curves were plotted to understand how the model behaves across different confidence thresholds:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Most classes show stable precision and recall in the confidence range of 0.7–0.9.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• shortsleeve and shortpants achieved exceptionally high scores across all confidence levels.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• On the other hand, zipup showed lower performance, likely due to visual overlap with similar items and data scarcity.

### 🔹 Label Distribution and Bounding Box Analysis

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;We also analyzed the label frequency distribution and spatial characteristics of bounding boxes:
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• denimpants, shortpants, and shortsleeve appeared frequently in the dataset, which correlates with their strong detection performance.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Bounding boxes are densely centered in the image frame, and their size distribution shows a healthy variety, reducing risk of spatial bias.

### 🔹 Summary of Model Performance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.744 across all classes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• shortpants, shortsleeve, and skirt demonstrated the most robust performance, suggesting practical application potential.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Confusion among jacket-type garments suggests future improvements could involve fine-grained loss functions or more specialized model architectures.
<br><br>
### 🔹 Batch-wise Prediction vs Ground Truth (Visual Analysis)

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;To complement numerical evaluation, we visualized prediction results for randomly sampled training and validation batches:
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.1.5a - train_batch0.jpg to train_batch21062.jpg show ground truth annotations in the training set.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.1.5b - val_batch0_labels.jpg, val_batch1_labels.jpg, val_batch2_labels.jpg show validation ground truth labels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.1.5c - val_batch0_pred.jpg, val_batch1_pred.jpg, val_batch2_pred.jpg display model predictions for the same validation samples.
<br>

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Key Observations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The model shows consistent performance across batches, especially for frequent classes like shortpants, skirt, and cottonpants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Confidence scores are generally high, often exceeding 0.85 for clean, well-lit samples (e.g., shortsleeve: 0.93, blazer: 0.97).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Rare classes like zipup or padding show lower prediction confidence and are occasionally confused with visually similar categories, reflecting the class imbalance noted in the training distribution.
<br><br>
### 🔹 False Positive / False Negative Examples (Qualitative Errors)

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;The added figure (ff2dbe3f-bf0a-4bbc-b704-21ad9ca3ea46.jpg) demonstrates common misclassification patterns:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• False Positives: Bounding boxes predicted for garments not present in ground truth, often caused by overlapping or ambiguous clothing views (e.g., shortpants vs. skirt).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• False Negatives: Some garments annotated in the ground truth were completely missed — especially darker or partially occluded items (e.g., hoodie under jacket).

&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis suggests the need for improved post-processing and better threshold tuning in deployment.
<br><br>
### 🔹 Label-Prediction Match Consistency

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;A side-by-side review of val_batch*_labels.jpg and val_batch*_pred.jpg showed:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• High spatial consistency in predicted bounding boxes (visually aligned with ground truth).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Moderate confusion between semantically similar categories like cardigan vs. jacket, and slacks vs. cottonpants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Emphasizes the need for consistent annotation guidelines when dealing with fine-grained apparel classes.
<br><br>
### 🔹 Overall Evaluation Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation suggests the YOLO-based clothing detection model is effective across most categories.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Strengths:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Strong generalization in diverse images (pose, lighting, occlusion).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• mAP@0.5 = 0.744 with especially high scores on shortsleeve, shortpants, and skirt.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• High confidence detection for common classes.


#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Frequent misclassification between similar garments (e.g., jacket vs. cardigan).
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Weak performance on rare or ambiguous classes like zipup, padding.


#### &nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Incorporate fine-grained losses or hierarchical class structures.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Apply focal loss or class reweighting for imbalance.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Consider vision-language models (e.g., OWL-ViT, YOLO-World) for open-vocabulary detection.

## 📷 Real-time Detection by webcam
To test the trained model in real time using your laptop's webcam:

  1. Install dependencies
    Make sure you have installed all required packages:

    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
  3. Run the script
    Execute the following command in your terminal:

    
    python run_yolov11_webcam.py
    
  3. Usage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A window will open showing your webcam feed with real-time bounding boxes and class labels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Press q to close the window and stop the program.

Note:

  - The webcam index (0) is set for the default laptop camera. Change it to 1 or another index if you use an external camera.
  - Make sure the model weights path in the script matches your actual file location.
  - 'weights_only_head', 'weight' file: both transfer-learned weights.
